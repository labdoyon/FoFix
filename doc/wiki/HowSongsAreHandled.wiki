=*How Song Files Are Handled With FoFiX*=
This is going to be an information page to understand the workings of song files.
This will go over things like
 # Which parts of a midi file are available for use,
 # Where and how starpower should be implemented and proper way to use it
 # How FoFiX read's the notes that separate different difficulty levels
 # Etc. 

This is mostly stuff related to how FoFiX, in general, reads and understands these different things in order to make new songs that will be FoFiX compliant, or fix previously done songs.

This is WIP right now. If you have any suggestions or knowledge you'd like to share to help this be useful to others in order to make new songs, or even correct song's not done correctly, just let us know and we will add it. This is a team effort to make this page.
