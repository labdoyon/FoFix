_This page is in the process of being revamped and completed._
_If anyone wants to chip in and help, please do, it's a big job._

=How to read this page=
This page lists all options from the settings menu in-game. It is split up into 2, for simple options and advanced options.
The far right column of the table is set aside for a description of the options.
If a setting has a '>' (_like this>_) at the right, it means selecting it enters into a sub-menu
If a setting has '< >' on either side (_<like this>_) it means you can choose a value for the option by pressing left or right.
Values (as opposed to settings) are marked as _italic_
Any value that is marked in *bold* is the default value for that option.

setting under (advanced menu version): Setlist Options -> NIL Show
Next Score

 * "Off" (default) - will show "NIL" for songs without the currently selected
difficulty in the songlist
 * "Auto" - will replace "NIL" score listing with the next available song
difficulty's score (for example, a custom song with only Hard and Expert difficulties
available would show the Hard score if the user was looking at Easy, Medium, or Hard
scores).
