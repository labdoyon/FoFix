= Introduction =

Ensure you are logged into GoogleCode, then...

Create a new folder on your PC named as you want and choose "SVN Checkout".

Use "https://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/" as your SVN checkout address, enter when prompted your username and your password. Here you find them:

   Username: [http://code.google.com/p/fofix/source/checkout] 
             (usually it's your email address on google code)

   Password: [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings]
             (it's the one in your google code profile settings page)

Now should start the update and once finished you are ready for committing. Remember to do a "SVN Update" before you start editing any file, because you could work on some code that someone just edited. When you've finished choose "SVN Commit". Also remember to write a short log entry to describe what you did. Good work!
